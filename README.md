# 📱 LingoToday Mobile App

## ✅ Setup Complete!

The mobile app is now ready to test. Here's how to run it:

## 🚀 How to Test the App

### Step 1: Start the Mobile App
In the Replit console, run these commands:
```bash
cd mobile-app
npm start
```

### Step 2: Open on Your Phone
1. **Install Expo Go** on your iPhone (from App Store)
2. **Scan the QR code** that appears in the console
3. **Wait for the app to load** on your device

### Step 3: Login
- Use your **existing LingoToday website credentials**
- Same email and password you use on the website
- The app connects to your running backend server

## 📝 Features Working

✅ **Login Screen** - Clean, professional interface
✅ **Authentication** - Connects to your existing backend
✅ **Dashboard** - Welcome message with user name
✅ **Mobile UI** - Touch-friendly buttons and navigation
✅ **Error Handling** - Clear messages for connection issues

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If you get "Could not connect to server":**
1. Make sure your main website backend is running (the one on port 5000)
2. Both your phone and computer must be on the same WiFi network
3. You might need to change `localhost` to your computer's IP address

**To find your computer's IP address:**
- **Windows:** Run `ipconfig` in command prompt
- **Mac/Linux:** Run `ifconfig` in terminal
- Look for your WiFi adapter's IP (usually starts with 192.168.x.x)

**If needed, update the IP in the app:**
- Edit `mobile-app/App.js`
- Line 20: Change `http://localhost:5000` to `http://YOUR_IP:5000`
